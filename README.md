# AI-Based Task Manager Agent

## Project Overview

This project is a lightweight AI-based Task Manager Agent built using **FastAPI**. It allows users to manage tasks through a RESTful API: create, read, update, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored locally in a JSON file, which makes the setup simple without needing any external database.

---

## Problem Statement

Managing personal or team tasks manually can be inefficient. The goal was to automate this through a backend API system that supports:

* Creating tasks
* Updating tasks
* Deleting tasks
* Retrieving all tasks

---

## Solution Architecture

```
AI_Task_Manager_Agent/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Main FastAPI app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tasks.json       # JSON storage for tasks
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ task_model.py    # Pydantic model for task validation
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ packages/                # Pre-downloaded wheel files (optional)
```

* **FastAPI** for API backend
* **Uvicorn** as ASGI server
* **Pydantic** for data validation
* **tasks.json** as lightweight database


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Task_Manager_Agent.git
cd AI_Task_Manager_Agent
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
